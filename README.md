# Next Steps

- [ ] None! This project was done to showcase the quality of the code I can write within a given time frame.
- [ ] Known bugs:
    - The tie count does not increment in the scoreboard after each game
    - The user can type anything they want into the prompts for a move (ie A1 = true, D7 = false and throws error)
