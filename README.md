# Py-Pac-Poe
This is a console game of Tic-Tac-Toe created in Python.  As part of a bonus project for the General Assembly: Software Immersive program, I completed this project in a two hour timeframe.

# Technologies Used

- Python

# Getting Started

- Run the command 'python3 main.py'
- Enter a number of games you and a player would like to play
- Alternate turns by making a move in a 3 x 3 grid (A1-C3)
- Continue play until a player wins the entered number of games

# Next Steps

- None! This project was done to showcase the quality of the code I can write within a given time frame.
- Known bugs:
    - The tie count does not increment in the scoreboard after each game
    - The user can type anything they want into the prompts for a move (ie A1 = true, D7 = false and throws error)
